# hyperflow-amqp-executor

Job executor for [Hyperflow](http://github.com/dice-cyfronet/hyperflow) workflow engine.

## Usage

Executor may be configured in two ways:

 * by using YAML configuration file (see `examples/settings.yml`) - path to that file should be passed as only argument
 * via environment variables:
   * `STORAGE` = cloud | nfs | local
   * Cloud storage defaults to AWS S3, for other providers use YAML-based config
   * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (for S3 cloud storage)
   * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (for S3 cloud storage)
   * `AMQP_URL`
   * `THREADS` (defaults to number of cores or 1 if it couldn't be determined)
   * `QUEUE_NAME` (defaults to "hyperflow.jobs")

To execute jobs:
  
`$ hyperflow-amqp-executor`

To collect some metrics:
  
`$ hyperflow-amqp-metric-collector`

## Supported use scenarios

### cloud: Cloud object data storage service

In this scenario, input and output files of jobs are stored in cloud object data storage service such as [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). In that case executor does the follwing:

* Create temporary directory
* Download input files
* Execute job in temporary directory
* Upload output files
* Remove temporary directory (anyway, app should remove temporary files itself)

Each task needs to provide some options:

* s3_bucket FIXME
* s3_prefix FIXME
* *(optionally)* cloud_storage â€“ same hash as in config file to use other than default storage provider

### nfs: (Slow) network file system

This case is similar to previous one, but executor will copy files from and copy results back to locally available filesystem. It may be NFS, SSHFS or other file system where directly working on remote data is not recommended.

Job options:

* workdir

### local: Local/network file system

In this scenario we assume that job is executed in shared directory available on execution node. It may be NFS/SMB/etc. share or local disk for single node deployments. There is no stage-in or stage-out phase, job is executed directly in specified directory, so that job must not leave any temporary files.

Job options:

* workdir


## Execution event monitoring

Executor publishes events for monitoring purpose by `hyperflow.events` exchange created on AMQP server. The exchange is topic type, so one may subscribe for specific event type. To request all messages request wildcard routing key `#`. Routing keys are as follows:

* `executor.ready`
* `job.{job-id}.started`
* `job.{job-id}.finished`
* `job.{job-id}.stage-in.started` - not applicable for `local` storage
* `job.{job-id}.stage-in.finished` - not applicable for `local` storage
* `job.{job-id}.execution.started`
* `job.{job-id}.execution.finished`
* `job.{job-id}.stage-out.started` - not applicable for `local` storage
* `job.{job-id}.stage-out.finished` - not applicable for `local` storage

Each event published in JSON provides:

* `executor`: UUID executor id 
* `timestamp`: UNIX timestamp (float in UTC timezone)
* `type`: Like routing key, but without job id part.

Events related to jobs also are provided with:

* `id`: Job id (AMQP correlation id)
* `thread`: Executor thread id (random looking number)

Stage finish events send some additional info: `job.*.stage-in.finished` and `job.*.stage-out.finished` provide `time` and `bytes` for transfer time and data size respectively. The event of `job.*.execution.finished` provides `executable` name, `metrics` and `exit_status`.


## Contributing to hyperflow-amqp-executor
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
